# Labb-1-Generics

This is a C# console application that demonstrates the use of generics in a simple scenario involving boxes. The application defines a Box class that represents a rectangular box with width, height, and length dimensions, and a BoxCollection class that is a collection of boxes. The BoxCollection class is implemented using a List<Box> object to store the boxes.

## The BoxCollection class has the following methods:

* Add(Box box): Adds a box to the collection.
* Remove(Box box): Removes a box from the collection. The box to remove is identified by its dimensions.
* Contains(Box box): Checks if a box is in the collection. The box to check is identified by its dimensions.
* The BoxSameDimensions class is used to compare boxes by their dimensions.
